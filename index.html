        <h2>Local Frenchman Squashed by Giant Inflatable Dumpling</h2>
        <h3>By Jimothy Hortonshire</h3>
        <h4>Monday, 09/27/21</h4>

        <p>
            On the evening of last Friday, on the cobblestone streets of Nice, France,
            John Manuel Lamborghini was suddenly struck with large object from above.
            A bystander, Jackery Francois, witnessed the incident and reported it to
            the French Metropolitan Police. 

            According to Francois, he stumbled upon the unconscious body of Lamborghini
            after a night of <i>"getting totally wasted, innit."</i> Lamborghini's current
            condition is stable and he is in currently being treated at L'ame Hopital.
            Francois noted that he heard someone scream, <i>"watch out for the dumpling!"</i><br><br>

            This morning, La Baguette informants confirmed that there was, in fact, a giant
            inflatable dumpling that fell on Lamborghini and it was discovered hidden in a nearby
            alley, deflated. Police are still investigating the case, the detective in charge is
            Senior Detective Dabig Bugatti. 

            Our journalists did have a hard time understanding Detective Bugatti's thick accent;
            this is the closest interpretation we were able to understand: <i>"Well, we do not really
            know for sure, here--there are so [many] people in the city. Everyone [is] always
            trying to find true "a penis" [happiness, probably]."</i><br><br>

            There has been a noticeable increase in cases like this ever since the grand debut of
            the Big Dupling political party. The BDP (Big Dumpling Party) is a party whose platform
            is based solely on lowering the prices for frozen dumplings for the general population.
            The BDP's president, Arya Dum, known coloquially as <i>"Queen Dumpling"</i> has created
            somewhat of an uproar. 

            Dumpling protests have been erupting all over the world in most of the major cities. 
            The advocacy of cheaper commercial dumpling prices has never had this much support. <br><br>

            Although many consider the BDP to be an illegitimate party, the polls show that they have
            garnered a considerable lead over their competitors and are likely to win control of the entire
            government <b>forever</b>.
