        <h2>Local Frenchman Squashed by Giant Inflatable Dumpling</h2>
        <h3>By Jimothy Hortonshire</h3>
        <h4>Monday, 09/27/21</h4>

        <p>
            On the evening of last Friday, on the cobblestone streets of Nice, France,
            John Manuel Lamborghini was suddenly struck with large object from above.
            A bystander, Jackery Francois, witnessed the incident and reported it to
            the French Metropolitan Police. <br><br>

            According to Francois, he stumbled upon the unconscious body of Lamborghini
            after a night of "getting totally wasted, innit." Lamborghini's current
            condition is stable and he is in currently being treated at L'ame Hopital.
            Francois noted that he heard someone scream, "watch out for the dumpling!" <br><br>

            This morning, La Baguette informants confirmed that there, in fact, was a giant
            inflatable dumpling that fell on Lamborghini. It was discovered hidden in a nearby
            alley, deflated. Police are still investigating the case, the detective in charge is
            Senior Detective Dabig Bugatti. <br><br>

            Our journalists did have a hard time understanding Detective Bugatti's thick accent;
            this is the closest interpretation we were able to understand: "Well, we do not really
            know for sure, here--there are so [many] people in the city. Everyone [is] always
            trying to find true "a penis" [happiness, probably]." <br><br>
